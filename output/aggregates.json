        "text": "How To Make Native Ads Work For You Hey Marketers\n\nI wanted to share something that’s been really effective for me lately in improving ad performance. It’s a straightforward method that leverages native's analytics—no gimmicks, just a smart way to use the tools available.\n\n Here’s a quick overview:\n\n**1.Start with the Right Audience:** Use a proxy to adjust your IP to the location you’re targeting. It’s all about matching your ads with the right audience.\n\n **2.Find What’s Working:** Visit a large Taboola or Outbrain publisher website, find an article, and look at the ads running in the Taboola feed. Pick one that stands out to you.\n\n**3.Analyze and Learn:** Paste the ad’s URL into native analytics. If the ad has been running for a long time and has a high engagement rate, it’s a sign that it’s working well.\n\n**4.Replicate the Success:** Use the insights from analytics to inform your own campaigns. Copy the targeting data and placements that are driving results.\n\n**5.Launch and Adjust:** Set up your campaign and monitor the results. Small tweaks can lead to big impressions.\n\nThis method has been a game-changer for me and I hope you find this useful.\n\nI’d love to hear if you try it out—just leave a comment here and let me know!",

        "text": "Need Advice: Building a Funnel to Drive In-Store Appointments for a High-End Retail Store I’m looking for advice and insights. About 10 years ago, I ran a successful eCommerce clothing business, and most of my marketing revolved around Facebook ads to drive website traffic. For people who didn’t immediately buy, I captured emails with a lead magnet, nurtured them via Mailchimp, and retargeted them with Facebook and Taboola ads. I also did influencer collaborations, blog posts, and YouTube videos.\n\nFast forward to today, I’ve been hired to run marketing for a brick-and-mortar retail clothing store that’s been around for 50+ years. They’ve historically relied on traditional marketing (TV, radio, newspapers), but now they’re trusting me to modernize their approach.\n\nHere’s the catch: the store doesn’t sell online, and due to brand/vendor agreements, they can’t. My focus is entirely on driving foot traffic and getting people to book in-store style consultations or request a callback to schedule one.\n\nWhat I’ve Done So Far:\n\n\t1.\tBuilt a new website (using SquareSpace) designed for booking appointments (vs. their old site, which was just a digital placeholder).\n\n\t2.\tSuccessfully booked 3 appointments organically since launch (a couple weeks ago) —so the process works, but I know I need to scale it up.\n\n\t3.\tSecured a marketing budget and the owner’s full support for 2025.\n\nWhat I’m Thinking for the Funnel\n\nHere’s where I need your advice. I want to build out a lead gen funnel to drive appointments. I’ve brainstormed some ideas and tools but would love feedback or suggestions:\n\n1. Video Content: Creating videos to showcase products, tell brand stories, feature employees, and highlight customer experiences.\n\n2. Paid Ads:\n\t•\tRunning ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google to drive traffic to the website.\n\t•\tEmphasizing lifestyle content, exclusive brands, and the benefits of a personal consultation.\n\t\n3. Postcards to Website Visitors: Considering services that retarget website visitors by sending a personalized postcard with a first-time customer offer.\n\t\n4. Website Chat: Using chat tools to engage website visitors and guide them to book an appointment.\n\t\n5. Google Reviews: Experimenting with tools like Zappy Cards that allow in-store shoppers to easily leave Google reviews by tapping their phone.\n\t\n6. Email & SMS Follow-Up: Automating follow-ups to ensure appointment confirmations and reduce no-shows.\n\nBig Question: Video-Based Funnel\n\nI’ve been wondering if I could adapt the strategies used for webinars, high-ticket offers, or digital products to build a video-based funnel for in-store appointments. \n\nFor example:\n\t• Using a video sales letter (VSL) to warm up leads and explain the benefits of a personal style consultation.\n\t• Capturing lead information with a compelling opt-in (e.g., “Download our free guide.” Or maybe a discount on their first store visit, etc).\n\t• Following up with email and SMS sequences to nurture them into booking an appointment.\n\nWhat I Need Help With: \n\n1. Does this approach make sense for a retail store funnel? Have you seen it work for similar businesses?\n\n2. What tools, services, or platforms would you recommend for:\n\t• Lead capture (e.g., opt-ins, forms, etc.)?\n\t• Video-based funnels and retargeting?\n\t• Appointment setting and follow-ups?\n\t• Retargeting visitors (both digital and offline strategies)?\n\t\n3. Are there experts or resources I should reach out to for guidance?\n\nI’m trying to make a huge impact with marketing this year, so I’m open to ideas, recommendations, or even just cautionary tales about what not to do.

It’s a straightforward method that leverages native's analytics—no gimmicks, just a smart way to use the tools available.\n\n Here’s a quick overview:\n\n**1.Start with the Right Audience:** Use a proxy to adjust your IP to the location you’re targeting. It’s all about matching your ads with the right audience.\n\n **2.Find What’s Working:** Visit a large Taboola or Outbrain publisher website, find an article, and look at the ads running in the Taboola feed. Pick one that stands out to you.\n\n**3.Analyze and Learn:** Paste the ad’s URL into native analytics. If the ad has been running for a long time and has a high engagement rate, it’s a sign that it’s working well.\n\n**4.Replicate the Success:** Use the insights from analytics to inform your own campaigns. Copy the targeting data and placements that are driving results.\n\n**5.Launch and Adjust:** Set up your campaign and monitor the results. Small tweaks can lead to big impressions.\n\nThis method has been a game-changer for me and I hope you find this useful.\n\nI’d love to hear if you try it out—just leave a comment here and let me know!",

It’s a straightforward method that leverages native's analytics—no gimmicks, just a smart way to use the tools available.\n\n Here’s a quick overview:\n\n**1.Start with the Right Audience:** Use a proxy to adjust your IP to the location you’re targeting. It’s all about matching your ads with the right audience.\n\n **2.Find What’s Working:** Visit a large Taboola or Outbrain publisher website, find an article, and look at the ads running in the Taboola feed. Pick one that stands out to you.\n\n**3.Analyze and Learn:** Paste the ad’s URL into native analytics. If the ad has been running for a long time and has a high engagement rate, it’s a sign that it’s working well.\n\n**4.Replicate the Success:** Use the insights from analytics to inform your own campaigns. Copy the targeting data and placements that are driving results.\n\n**5.Launch and Adjust:** Set up your campaign and monitor the results. Small tweaks can lead to big impressions.\n\nThis method has been a game-changer for me and I hope you find this useful.\n\nI’d love to hear if you try it out—just leave a comment here and let me know!",

          "text": "Need Advice: Building a Funnel to Drive In-Store Appointments for a High-End Retail Store I’m looking for advice and insights. About 10 years ago, I ran a successful eCommerce clothing business, and most of my marketing revolved around Facebook ads to drive website traffic. For people who didn’t immediately buy, I captured emails with a lead magnet, nurtured them via Mailchimp, and retargeted them with Facebook and Taboola ads. I also did influencer collaborations, blog posts, and YouTube videos.\n\nFast forward to today, I’ve been hired to run marketing for a brick-and-mortar retail clothing store that’s been around for 50+ years. They’ve historically relied on traditional marketing (TV, radio, newspapers), but now they’re trusting me to modernize their approach.\n\nHere’s the catch: the store doesn’t sell online, and due to brand/vendor agreements, they can’t. My focus is entirely on driving foot traffic and getting people to book in-store style consultations or request a callback to schedule one.\n\nWhat I’ve Done So Far:\n\n\t1.\tBuilt a new website (using SquareSpace) designed for booking appointments (vs. their old site, which was just a digital placeholder).\n\n\t2.\tSuccessfully booked 3 appointments organically since launch (a couple weeks ago) —so the process works, but I know I need to scale it up.\n\n\t3.\tSecured a marketing budget and the owner’s full support for 2025.\n\nWhat I’m Thinking for the Funnel\n\nHere’s where I need your advice. I want to build out a lead gen funnel to drive appointments. I’ve brainstormed some ideas and tools but would love feedback or suggestions:\n\n1. Video Content: Creating videos to showcase products, tell brand stories, feature employees, and highlight customer experiences.\n\n2. Paid Ads:\n\t•\tRunning ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google to drive traffic to the website.\n\t•\tEmphasizing lifestyle content, exclusive brands, and the benefits of a personal consultation.\n\t\n3. Postcards to Website Visitors: Considering services that retarget website visitors by sending a personalized postcard with a first-time customer offer.\n\t\n4. Website Chat: Using chat tools to engage website visitors and guide them to book an appointment.\n\t\n5. Google Reviews: Experimenting with tools like Zappy Cards that allow in-store shoppers to easily leave Google reviews by tapping their phone.\n\t\n6. Email & SMS Follow-Up: Automating follow-ups to ensure appointment confirmations and reduce no-shows.\n\nBig Question: Video-Based Funnel\n\nI’ve been wondering if I could adapt the strategies used for webinars, high-ticket offers, or digital products to build a video-based funnel for in-store appointments. \n\nFor example:\n\t• Using a video sales letter (VSL) to warm up leads and explain the benefits of a personal style consultation.\n\t• Capturing lead information with a compelling opt-in (e.g., “Download our free guide.” Or maybe a discount on their first store visit, etc).\n\t• Following up with email and SMS sequences to nurture them into booking an appointment.\n\nWhat I Need Help With: \n\n1. Does this approach make sense for a retail store funnel? Have you seen it work for similar businesses?\n\n2. What tools, services, or platforms would you recommend for:\n\t• Lead capture (e.g., opt-ins, forms, etc.)?\n\t• Video-based funnels and retargeting?\n\t• Appointment setting and follow-ups?\n\t• Retargeting visitors (both digital and offline strategies)?\n\t\n3. Are there experts or resources I should reach out to for guidance?\n\nI’m trying to make a huge impact with marketing this year, so I’m open to ideas, recommendations, or even just cautionary tales about what not to do. Thanks in advance for your help!",

I want to build out a lead gen funnel to drive appointments. I’ve brainstormed some ideas and tools but would love feedback or suggestions:\n\n1. Video Content: Creating videos to showcase products, tell brand stories, feature employees, and highlight customer experiences.\n\n2. Paid Ads:\n\t•\tRunning ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google to drive traffic to the website.\n\t•\tEmphasizing lifestyle content, exclusive brands, and the benefits of a personal consultation.\n\t\n3. Postcards to Website Visitors: Considering services that retarget website visitors by sending a personalized postcard with a first-time customer offer.\n\t\n4. Website Chat: Using chat tools to engage website visitors and guide them to book an appointment.\n\t\n5. Google Reviews: Experimenting with tools like Zappy Cards that allow in-store shoppers to easily leave Google reviews by tapping their phone.\n\t\n6. Email & SMS Follow-Up: Automating follow-ups to ensure appointment confirmations and reduce no-shows.\n\nBig Question: Video-Based Funnel\n\nI’ve been wondering if I could adapt the strategies used for webinars, high-ticket offers, or digital products to build a video-based funnel for in-store appointments. \n\nFor example:\n\t• Using a video sales letter (VSL) to warm up leads and explain the benefits of a personal style consultation.\n\t• Capturing lead information with a compelling opt-in (e.g., “Download our free guide.” Or maybe a discount on their first store visit, etc).\n\t• Following up with email and SMS sequences to nurture them into booking an appointment.\n\nWhat I Need Help With: \n\n1. Does this approach make sense for a retail store funnel? Have you seen it work for similar businesses?\n\n2. What tools, services, or platforms would you recommend for:\n\t• Lead capture (e.g., opt-ins, forms, etc.)?\n\t• Video-based funnels and retargeting?\n\t• Appointment setting and follow-ups?\n\t• Retargeting visitors (both digital and offline strategies)?\n\t\n3. Are there experts or resources I should reach out to for guidance?\n\nI’m trying to make a huge impact with marketing this year, so I’m open to ideas, recommendations, or even just cautionary tales about what not to do. Thanks in advance for your help!",
